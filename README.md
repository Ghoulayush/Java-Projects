- ‚úÖ Apply best practices and design patterns


## üìö Resources I'm Using

- üìñ [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- üì± [Online Java Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
- üì∫ [YouTube Learning Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOOj_NOZYq_R2PECIMglLemc&si=LZt-2GgdvEjWzv3s)

## üí° Reflections

As I complete each project, I'll add my thoughts and lessons learned here.

### Project 1: Shopping Cart Program
Created a simple console shopping cart that handles item name, price, and quantity to calculate purchase totals.

**Learned**: Scanner input, data types (String, double, int), basic I/O, arithmetic operations, and string concatenation.

### Project 2: Compound Interest Calculator
Developed a console application to calculate compound interest using user inputs for principal, rate, compounding frequency, and time period.

**Learned**: Advanced mathematical calculations using `Math.pow()`, formatted output with `System.out.printf()`, handling financial calculations, and precise decimal representations.

**Key Techniques**: Scanner input, mathematical formulas, type conversion, and basic financial computation.

### Project 3: Weight Converter
Created a console application that converts weights between pounds and kilograms using user-selected conversion options.

**Learned**: Conditional logic with `if-else`, user input validation, type conversion, and implementing simple conversion formulas.

**Key Techniques**: Menu-driven program, mathematical conversions, formatted output, and basic error handling.

### Project 4: Banking Program
Implemented a simple console-based banking application with options to check balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit.

**Learned**: Loop-based menu systems, modular programming with static methods, parameter passing, switch expressions (->), and persistent state management.

**Key Techniques**: Input validation, maintaining state across operations, defensive programming (checking for negative values and insufficient funds), and user interface design.

### Project 5: Dice Roller Application
Developed a console-based application that simulates rolling multiple dice with visual representation of each die face and calculates the total sum.

**Learned**: Random number generation, ASCII art implementation using text blocks, switch expressions with arrow syntax, and accumulating values across iterations.

**Key Techniques**: User input validation, ASCII art for visualization, Java text blocks, switch expressions, loops for multiple dice rolls, and running totals.

### Project 6: Java Slot Machine
Developed a console-based slot machine game that simulates a real-world slot machine with multiple symbols, betting system, and dynamic payouts based on matching patterns.

**Learned**: Managing game state, implementing game mechanics with random outcomes, creating engaging user interfaces in console applications, and handling in-game currency/economy.

**Key Techniques**: Random symbol generation, pattern matching for win conditions, variable payout calculations based on symbol value, game loop management, and handling persistent game state between rounds.

### Project 7: Java Music / Audio Player
Developed a console-based audio player application that can play, stop, and reset audio files (.wav, .au, .aiff) using Java's sound API.

**Learned**: Working with Java's sound API (javax.sound.sampled), handling audio streams, resource management with try-with-resources, and implementing audio playback controls.

**Key Techniques**: File I/O operations, audio stream management, exception handling with multiple catch blocks, try-with-resources for automatic resource cleanup, and implementing an interactive menu system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
- Visual Studio Code with Java extensions
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Additional libraries and frameworks as needed
