- 📱 [Online Java Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
- 📺 [YouTube Learning Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOOj_NOZYq_R2PECIMglLemc&si=LZt-2GgdvEjWzv3s)

## 💡 Reflections

As I complete each project, I'll add my thoughts and lessons learned here.

### Project 1: Shopping Cart Program
Created a simple console shopping cart that handles item name, price, and quantity to calculate purchase totals.

**Learned**: Scanner input, data types (String, double, int), basic I/O, arithmetic operations, and string concatenation.

### Project 2: Compound Interest Calculator
Developed a console application to calculate compound interest using user inputs for principal, rate, compounding frequency, and time period.

**Learned**: Advanced mathematical calculations using `Math.pow()`, formatted output with `System.out.printf()`, handling financial calculations, and precise decimal representations.

**Key Techniques**: Scanner input, mathematical formulas, type conversion, and basic financial computation.

### Project 3: Weight Converter
Created a console application that converts weights between pounds and kilograms using user-selected conversion options.

**Learned**: Conditional logic with `if-else`, user input validation, type conversion, and implementing simple conversion formulas.

**Key Techniques**: Menu-driven program, mathematical conversions, formatted output, and basic error handling.

### Project 4: Banking Program
Implemented a simple console-based banking application with options to check balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit.

**Learned**: Loop-based menu systems, modular programming with static methods, parameter passing, switch expressions (->), and persistent state management.

**Key Techniques**: Input validation, maintaining state across operations, defensive programming (checking for negative values and insufficient funds), and user interface design.

### Project: Dice Roller Application
Developed a console-based application that simulates rolling multiple dice with visual representation of each die face and calculates the total sum.

**Learned**: Random number generation, ASCII art implementation using text blocks, switch expressions with arrow syntax, and accumulating values across iterations.

**Key Techniques**: User input validation, ASCII art for visualization, Java text blocks, switch expressions, loops for multiple dice rolls, and running totals.
